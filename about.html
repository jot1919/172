                        <p>Parenting or teaching K-12 students often challenges the mental well-being of everyone involved. Building on Dr. Young's research and his book "Stick With It", this track aims to explore the psychology behind how to inspire children to cultivate lasting passions in different subjects.</p>
                        
                        <p>Through user interviews and discussions with role-model kids, the team works to identify common struggles parents and teachers face, and to provide practical, research-backed strategies for boosting kids' engagement and motivation.</p>
                        
                        <p>A key deliverable is a website introducing Dr. Young's upcoming podcast, which will showcase these insights and encourage healthier, more enthusiastic learning for K-12 youth.</p>
