            <h2>Introducing the Problem</h2>
            <p>According to the <a href="https://www.psychiatry.org/news-room/news-releases/annual-poll-adults-express-increasing-anxiousness">American Psychiatric Association</a>, anxiety and depression rates continue to soar in the United States—43% of adults report feeling more anxious than last year. The year prior, it was 37%, and before that, 32%. While these statistics focus on adults, research indicates that stressful life events in adolescence are closely linked to higher anxiety sensitivity, underscoring the importance of addressing mental health needs early in life.</p>

            <h2>Impact on Youth</h2>
            <p>Children and teenagers often face academic pressures, social challenges, and emotional changes that can escalate without proper coping mechanisms. Many young people have limited experience in identifying and expressing how they feel, and when left unchecked, these emotional struggles can carry over into adulthood—potentially worsening existing mental health conditions.</p>
            <blockquote class="student-quote">
                <p>"Having more guidance on emotional literacy in school or at home would have been beneficial. Learning specific strategies to identify and cope with emotions could have made it easier to navigate challenging feelings."</p>

                    <h3>High Costs & Limited Access</h3>
                    <p>Therapies and premium apps can be expensive or uncovered by insurance, putting consistent professional support out of reach for many families.</p>

                <h2>Why Our Approach Is Different</h2>
                <p>Our goal is to empower children by helping them build emotional awareness and resilience before problems escalate. Unlike costly or highly specialized options, our solution:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Delivers Daily, Engaging Questionnaires: Short, fun, and thoughtful prompts drawn from inspirational sources that invite children to reflect on their day and emotions.</li>
                    <li>Offers a Consistent Routine: Simple reminders and journaling streaks encourage ongoing use, building healthy habits around self-expression.</li>
                    <li>Prioritizes Accessibility: By focusing on a digital journaling platform, we aim to make emotional support tools more widely available to youth, regardless of economic or geographic constraints.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>By honing in on child-friendly prompts and regular self-reflection, our project tackles a critical gap in early mental health support—fostering emotional literacy in adolescence so that future generations can step into adulthood better equipped to handle life's pressures.</p>
